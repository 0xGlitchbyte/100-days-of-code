# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Glitchbyte

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 26th, 2023].

## Log

### R1D1 
Setup repos for 100 days. Started a C codebase with context cracking.

### R1D2
Finished context cracking. Started defining basic types. Since Im using the C89 standard, I cant use stdint.h.
I'll have to define my own `int64` and `uint64`. Also may define `isize` and `usize` for the heck of it.

### R1D3
